        <li>For my Eagle Scout Project, I labeled storm
          drain in my community to help stop the
          polution of the Chesapeake Bay.</li>
        <li>My High School had the goal of hosting a band
          compatition. In order to do that, we had to
          raise the funds to do that.</li>
        <li>My dad and I wanted to redo our deck but we
          decided to do it by ourselves. Over the course
          of a month, we took apart the deck that we had and made a new one.</li>
